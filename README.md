Transforming Agriculture with AI and Drones
--------------------------------------------

Welcome to the Transforming Agriculture with AI and Drones project! This repository combines computer vision, machine learning, and drone technology using Azure Custom Vision to create a smarter approach to farming. Our system deploys drones equipped with intelligent algorithms to identify key agricultural areas and enable precision fertilization. This innovation not only boosts crop yield but also reduces the environmental impact of traditional farming methods.

Features
-----------

Advanced Computer Vision: Leverage Azure Custom Vision to identify crop types, detect unhealthy plants, and pinpoint weed infestations.
Autonomous Drone Operations: Use drones with high-resolution cameras and onboard processing power for real-time data collection and analysis.
Targeted Fertilization: Apply fertilizers only where needed, reducing overuse and ensuring optimal plant growth.
Reduced Environmental Footprint: Lower the use of chemicals in farming, promoting a more sustainable agricultural approach.
Enhanced Crop Management: Implement smart algorithms for efficient crop monitoring and data-driven decision-making.
